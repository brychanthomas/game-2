This is a game with graphics by Ronan Carolan and programming by Brychan Thomas.

You are an astronaut whose spaceship has crashed into a school. The objective of
the game is to build a radio transmitter and call for help. To do this you must
search the school and find items that you can combine together to produce other
items, eventually leading to the creation of a radio transmitter.

The game was created using the Phaser 3 JavaScript game framework.
